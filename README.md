3D Dice is an augmented reality application that allows you to roll a virtual dice anywhere you'd like! All you need is your phone and this app. Using Apple's latest ARKit tech, 3D Dice is able to detect horizontal surfaces in the real world for you to throw dice onto. It even animates them being rolled when you shake your phone or tap the roll button! DISCLAIMER: The intellectual property of this app belongs to the London App Brewery, this is simply my rendition of it through following along with Angela Yu's Complete iOS 13 Bootcamp Course.
